##### Hello and welcome to the Historic Starter Decks section of the site. The intention of this page is to list decks that have low resource requirements to help enable newer players to get into the incredible format that is Historic. 

Historic is Magic the Gathering Arena's eternal format, which means nearly every card ever released on the platform is available for use. This makes Historic incredibly broad and powerful, but also means that newer players are unlikely to have all the cards they need to build decks for it.

These decks aim to bridge the gap between many players and Historic in general. They contain only 10 Rares, at least 4 of which are lands that can be played in many other decks, and 2 Mythics. The decks are designed to be fun, somewhat off meta, and to win an average amount in the "Play" queue or ranks up to platinum. 

These decks are not designed to be ultra competitive, fast, or efficient decks. Care is not taken to spend wildcards efficiently on format staples or craft cards that go into multiple decks. You'll get a cheap deck you can use in the format at a low cost, but you may not get the pieces you need to rise the ranks to Mythic the next season.

### Overview

This deck is all about small incremental value backed up by a decent dose of removal. At first glance Oni-Cult Anvil seems like a pretty weak card, but it can provide a very large amount of value if your willing to build around it. A good amount of that value is build around Dragonspark Reactor which can get very large very quickly and threaten your opponents life total or best creature. Finally you'll get some minor value with Reinforced Ronin who can finish off planeswalkers or simply trigger your Anvil or Reactor turn after turn. Plus it makes an excellent crewer for Mukotai Soulripper.

### Overview

This deck is all about aggressive creatures being buffed by equipment and swinging in. The equipment archetype is a great budget archetype. Even though many of the best equipment are higher rarity, there are plenty of payoffs and even some filler equipment cards at the lower rarities as well. Maul of the Skyclaves and Embercleave are big here because many of our cards grow quite large and preventing double blocks means we keep them around. The lifelink from Shadowspear and the Haste from Rabbit Battery also means we can survive against aggro and comeback after a wrath.

### Overview

Love it or hate it, Mill is a thing. And if your one of the ones who loves it, this deck might be for you. The deck revolves around draw based mill cards like Psychic Corrosion and Teferi's Tutelage to deck opponents out while doing what you already want to do, drawing cards. You'll have the chance to double up card draw with Teferi's Ageless Insight and control the board with counters and bounce spells. And of course two copies of Teferi, Hero of Dominaria make sure you have some staying power to end the game.

### Overview

The skeleton tribe definitely deserves some respect in the budget rankings. It might not be as explosive as elves, or as aggressive as goblins but it puts up some really goos showings if you can delay the game long enough to get key cards like Skeletal Swarming, Death-Priest of Myrkul or Moldervine Reclamation online. The rest of the shell is removal, ramp, and card draw to keep us churning through the deck.

### Overview

This deck is all about dropping haymakers and then hasting them up to swing in for big attacks. Threats like Elder Gargaroth, Trollbred Guardian and Proud Wildbonder can push out some serious damage when pumped up with Halana and Alena, Partners. You'll also have plenty of removal to handle any early game threats that try and take you out before you can haste your threats out.

9 Snow-Covered Swamp (MH1) 252
{%enddeck%}

### Overview

Zombies are one Magics first class tribes. They get plenty of lords and effects even at the common and uncommon levels. The sheer amount of lords means this deck can go over the top of opponents (Quite literally with Eternal Skylord) and Necroduality means we can often go pretty wide as well. It's not uncommon to drop two lords into a Necroduality and end up smashing your opponents face for most of their life. Narfi, Betrayer King gives us some chance of recovery after wraths and Cobbled Lancer is both a cheap creature when we need one, and card draw when we have extra mana to burn.

### Overview

This deck is all about drawing cards, going wide, and then jamming in with a big evasive threat for the win. Cards like Sythis, Harvest's Hand, Enchantress's Presence, and Satyr Enchanter make sure our hand stays full while Destiny Spinner and All That Glitters can give us big beaters then use Archon of Sun's Grace to make flying attackers or use Alseid of Life's Bounty to give protection and swing through.
