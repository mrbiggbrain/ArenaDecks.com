##### Hello and welcome to the Historic Starter Decks section of the site. The intention of this page is to list decks that have low resource requirements to help enable newer players to get into the incredible format that is Historic. 

Historic is Magic the Gathering Arena's eternal format, which means nearly every card ever released on the platform is available for use. This makes Historic incredibly broad and powerful, but also means that newer players are unlikely to have all the cards they need to build decks for it.

These decks aim to bridge the gap between many players and Historic in general. They contain only 10 Rares*, at least 4 of which are lands that can be played in many other decks, and 2 Mythics. The decks are designed to be fun, somewhat off meta, and to win an average amount in the "Play" queue or ranks up to platinum. 

These decks are not designed to be ultra competitive, fast, or efficient decks. Care is not taken to spend wildcards efficiently on format staples or craft cards that go into multiple decks. You'll get a cheap deck you can use in the format at a low cost, but you may not get the pieces you need to rise the ranks to Mythic the next season. 

 **For fans of my previous decks you'll not that I have increased the rare count from 6 to 10 and used 4 lands over the previous 2. I had many players comment that they wanted a little more 'oomph' and I still felt this was a fairly budget approach for a wide range of decks*

<!-- Elves -->

{% deck "Elves" %}
4 Elvish Archdruid
2 Beast Whisperer
2 Craterhoof Behemoth
4 Llanowar Elves
4 Imperious Perfect
4 Elvish Visionary
4 Llanowar Visionary
4 Jaspera Sentinel
4 Dwynen's Elite
2 Castle Garenbrig
2 Faceless Haven
2 Reclamation Sage
4 Boreal Outrider
18 Snow-Covered Forest

{% enddeck %}

**Elves** is such a fun deck to play. This deck is all about going wide and playing a bunch of creatures. Early game ramp such as {%card%}Llanowar Elves{%endcard%} and {%card%}Jaspera Sentinel{%endcard%} get your plan started early. You'll have no problem playing multiple creatures per turn with powerhouse mana producer {%card%}Elvish Archdruid{%endcard%} on the board. {%card%}Beast Whisperer{%endcard%} ensures you'll always have something to play, often drawing you multiple plays per turn. The ultimate goal of the deck is to ramp into {%card%}Craterhoof Behemoth{%endcard%} for a big aggressive attack. 

You'll find plenty of other great cards in this deck that enable the plan. Incidental card draw and even the ultra affordable {%card%}Imperious Perfect{%endcard%} ensure that you always have something to spend your mana on. 

<!-- Jund Reanimator -->

{% deck "Jund Reanimator" %}
4 Drakuseth, Maw of Flames
4 Forest
4 Unbreakable Bond
4 Mountain
4 Back for More
3 Swamp
2 Purphoros, Bronze-Blooded
4 Bond of Revival
4 Titanoth Rex
2 Krosan Tusker
4 Sanctuary Smasher
2 Blood Crypt
2 Overgrown Tomb
2 Stomping Ground
3 Binding the Old Gods
2 Deathsprout
2 Bloodfell Caves
2 Jungle Hollow
2 Rugged Highlands
4 Cathartic Reunion

{% enddeck %}

**Jund Reanimator** is all about cheating big creatures out when your opponent least expects it. No matter if your discarding them with {%card%}Cathartic Reunion{%endcard%} or cycling them away you'll have plenty of big beefy bodies to bring back.

This deck contains some truly big hitters with full playsets of {%card%}Drakuseth, Maw of Flames{%endcard%},  {%card%}Titanoth Rex{%endcard%}, and {%card%}Sanctuary Smasher{%endcard%} acting as great reanimation targets. 

But it's not a reanimation deck without multiple ways to get those beefy bodies back. {%card%}Unbreakable Bond{%endcard%} and {%card%}Bond of Revival{%endcard%} act as your standard reanimation spells, while {%card%}Back for More{%endcard%} pulls double duty at instant speed. 

Finally a flexible removal package of {%card%}Binding the Old Gods{%endcard%} and {%card%}Deathsprout{%endcard%} both deals with threats and ramps you towards your reanimation spells or hard casting your creatures.

<!-- Boros Equipment -->

{% deck "Boros Equipment" %}
2 Embercleave
7 Mountain
2 Sram, Senior Edificer
5 Plains
2 Akiri, Fearless Voyager
2 Maul of the Skyclaves
4 Danitha Capashen, Paragon
4 Champion of the Flame
4 Valduk, Keeper of the Flame
4 Team Pennant
3 Shock
3 Lava Coil
4 Dwarven Hammer
4 Sacred Foundry
2 Axgard Armory
4 Wind-Scarred Crag
4 Goblin Gaveleer

{% enddeck %}

*"BE AGRESSIVE! BE BE AGRESSIVE"*

**Boros Equipment** is a fast and fun aggressive deck that aims to suit up small creatures with equipment synergies to take games over quickly.  From giant bombs like {%card%}Embercleave{%endcard%} or {%card%}Maul of the Skyclaves{%endcard%} to synergistic creatures like {%card%}Champion of the Flame{%endcard%}, {%card%}Valduk, Keeper of the Flame{%endcard%}, or {%card%}Goblin Gaveleer{%endcard%}. 

But the deck is more then just a drop your hand aggro deck. You'll have plenty of chances to draw cards with {%card%}Sram, Senior Edificer{%endcard%} or {%card%}Akiri, Fearless Voyager{%endcard%} when your empty handed.

A small but aggressive removal package of {%card%}Shock{%endcard%} and {%card%}Lava Coil{%endcard%} keeps the other players honest while you charge in on the offensive. 

<!-- Blink -->

{% deck "Blink" %}
4 Ephemerate
8 Swamp
4 Ravenous Chupacabra
8 Plains
4 Thraben Inspector
2 Wrath of God
2 Emiel the Blessed
4 Flicker of Fate
4 Justiciar's Portal
4 Omen of the Dead
4 Dusk Legion Zealot
4 Burglar Rat
4 Godless Shrine
4 Scoured Barrens

{% enddeck %}

**Blink** focuses on incremental value from ETB effects. The deck includes great targets for creature removal ({%card%}Ravenous Chupacabra{%endcard%}), card draw ({%card%}Dusk Legion Zealot{%endcard%}), and forced discard ({%card%}Burglar Rat{%endcard%}) plus with 6 flicker spells including a full playset of {%card%}Ephemerate{%endcard%} you'll have plenty of chances to trigger effects at the very best possible time.

The deck also includes {%card%}Emiel the Blessed{%endcard%} which enables some truly wild shenanigans and can easily take over the game when unanswered long enough (Who doesn't like blinking a Burglar Rat just after the opponents draw step.)

This might not be the most powerful deck on the list, but it's super fun if you like two for one exchanges and fizzling your opponents spells or abilities. 

<!-- Skeletons -->

{% deck "Skeletons" %}

4 Sanitarium Skeleton
4 Village Rites
4 Reassembling Skeleton
2 Masked Vandal
4 Death Baron
2 Bloodline Pretender

4 Death-Priest of Myrkul
4 Binding the Old Gods
2 Skeletal Swarming
2 Moldervine Reclamation
2 The Great Henge
4 Overgrown Tomb
4 Jungle Hollow
7 Forest
7 Swamp

{% enddeck %}

Skeleton Tribal. Yes you heard me, Skeleton Tribal. This deck packs more punch then you might be expecting. With a full 8 lords and plenty of card advantage you'll have no problem chipping in for damage turn after turn. {%card%}Death Baron{%endcard%} is guaranteed to make your opponents blocks less favorable, while {%card%}Death-Priest of Myrkul{%endcard%} is a great way to make sure your always swinging in with your creatures. Finally {%card%}Skeletal Swarming{%endcard%} can overwhelm your opponent very quickly, especially if your creatures are getting death touch. 

{%card%}Village Rites{%endcard%}, {%card%}Moldervine Reclamation{%endcard%}, and {%card%}The Great Henge{%endcard%} ensure your hand is always filled with cards to play and a full suit of recursive threats ({%card%}Sanitarium Skeleton{%endcard%}, {%card%}Reassembling Skeleton{%endcard%}) ensure that you'll always have threats to spend your mana on. 

A small but effective removal package ({%card%}Binding the Old Gods{%endcard%}) makes sure you can deal with a wide range of permeants while serving to move you along towards your plan.
