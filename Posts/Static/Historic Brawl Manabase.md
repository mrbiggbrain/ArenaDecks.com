# Overview

This guide aims to give you a general starting point for 100 Card Historic Brawl manabases. This is not the definitive guide but rather a starting point for building your next one, two, three, or more color Historic Brawl deck. This guide is a living document and may change over time as new options become available.

## Lands

Like most mono-color mana bases, this mono-white mana base focuses on consistency by running 26 plains. The rest of the mana base focuses on card draw, creature lands and token generation, and a small number of MDFCs to give added value without hurting the mana base too much.

## Ramp

We are focused on a colorless artifact based ramp package using two, three and four mana cost artifacts. With plenty of plains and only a single color of mana we can afford to use some of the two mana colorless ramp spells to gain some quick mana advantage.

Our three mana package is all about mana rocks that can provide extra value like buffing our creatures and tapping our opponents creatures.

Like most mono-color mana bases, this mono-blue mana base focuses on consistency by running 26 islands. The rest of the mana base focuses on card draw & scry, creature lands, and a small number of MDFCs to give added value without hurting the mana base too much.
