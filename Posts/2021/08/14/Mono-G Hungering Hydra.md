## Overview

When I first started playing Magic years ago I went out and bought a Fat Pack of M19 and started cracking it open. One of the very first cards I opened all those years ago was {%card%}Hungering Hydra{%endcard%}. There was just something about that card that appealed to what I wanted out of Magic, attacking in, not being multi-blocked, getting bigger. 

I ended up buying some Ixalan as well, and a few singles, and built a deck very similar to the one you see here to play against a few of the guys I worked with. I fell in love with the playstyle and it's still one of my favorite decks to this day. 

## Lands

You can't get much simpler then this. 22 Basic Snow lands.

## Ramp

We want big hydras, so what better way to get there then to run tons of ramp.

## Hit Me Bro!

The theme of the deck is to fight our opponents creatures and keep the board clear for big hydras. So we are running a selection of creatures that can gain bonuses from being dealt damage using Hungering Hydra and the Enrage Mechanic.

## Fight Club

We run a ton fight spells. With 14 total ways to force our creatures to fight it's pretty common we will have one on hand when needed. Blizzard Brawl is by far the best one since we can fight a much larger creature to pump our hydra then swing in with a massive indestructible threat. Cartouche of Strength is also very good because it gives our hydra trample.

## Staying Alive

One of the issues with these kinds of all in creature builds is they are weak to removal and interaction. We are running Heroic Intervention to try and prevent those kind of major turns. Plus Blizzard Brawl can keep us alive even when we are making normally bad blocks.

## No One Expects The...

No one expects the Stony Strength. The ability to untap a creature and give it a counter for a single green mana at instant speed can not be over stated. This is the kind of blowout that can alter the path of a game. Many players will attack into a board of tapped creatures only to have their best creature decimated and mine grow, plus the ability to offer the opponent a trade, then snatch it out of their hands for a single green is something no one expects.
