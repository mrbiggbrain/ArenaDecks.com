## Overview

With the announcement of 100 card Historic Brawl coming back (At least somewhat) permanently I decided there was no better way to celebrate then to brew my very favorite commander for the format {%card%}Korvold, Fae-Cursed King{%endcard%} not once, but **twice**. This second version of the deck I will be showing off is a fun and janky dragon tribal deck. This version is designed to be filled with fun tribal cards that are less punishing and brutal as the sacrifice version. 

## Lands

Most of the mana base is pretty basic, a good number of dual lands, some basics, and a few utility lands. But we have made a few specific choices when it comes to the manabase for this deck. We have included all of the fetches, including Evolving Wilds and the honorary member Field of Ruin. We also have a few cards that power up the deck and help it in various situations.

1 Arch of Orazca
1 Blast Zone
1 Bonders' Enclave
1 Cryptic Caves
