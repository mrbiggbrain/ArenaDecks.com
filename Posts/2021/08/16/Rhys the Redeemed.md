Commander
1 Rhys the Redeemed

{%enddeck%}

## Overview

Let's make some tokens. This deck is all about making as many tokens as possible. Our commander is cheap, our plan is simple, make tokens, then more tokens, then attack with our tokens, then watch the opponents avatar explode. What could be simpler then that? 

## Lands

We start this deck how we start many, with basic lands. This deck is packing 5 each of Plains and Forests. 

{%cardlist%}

5 Plains
5 Forest

{%endcardlist%}

We are also running all the normal dual lands for the format.

{%cardlist%}

1 Arctic Treeline
1 Blossoming Sands
1 Branchloft Pathway // Boulderloft Pathway
1 Scattered Groves
1 Selesnya Guildgate
1 Sunpetal Grove
1 Temple Garden

1 Tranquil Expanse

{%endcardlist%}

A selection of any color lands and a World Tree help us add just a few more mana sources. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Command Tower
1 Mirrodin's Core
1 The World Tree

{%endcardlist%}

Our utility land slots are filled with two Castles and two memorials for some extra value. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Castle Ardenvale
1 Castle Garenbrig
1 Memorial to Glory
1 Memorial to Unity

{%endcardlist%}

Additionally we have a few utility lands dedicated to card draw. Arch can do some real work as we can often get the cities blessing pretty quickly.

{%cardlist%}

1 Arch of Orazca
1 Bonders' Enclave

{%endcardlist%}

We are running a whole range of MDFC lands for the additional value as well.
