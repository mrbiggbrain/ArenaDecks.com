## Overview

This deck is about one thing, casting dragons and lots of them. You'll want to put up some resistance long enough to stick a Tiamat and watch as the value starts flowing. 

## Lands

5 Color commanders are tough in brawl. To try and make casting our commander a little more of a reality we have a multitude of any color lands. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Ancient Ziggurat
1 Archway Commons
1 Cascading Cataracts
1 Command Tower
1 Gateway Plaza
1 Mirrodin's Core

In addition we are running a couple lands that can help us fix our mana for one color, or every color once we have enough lands overall. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Temple of the Dragon Queen
1 The World Tree

{%endcardlist%}

We are also running the full set of shock lands to give us the best chance of hitting all our colors on curve.
