## Overview

Sometimes you just want to play something different, something that's not your normal run of the mill powerhouse commander. Quintorius is that kind of commander. An uncommon rarity Boros color graveyards matter commander is quite a mouthful for sure, but as long as your looking for something fun over ultra competitive this might scratch your itch. 

## Lands

Our deck is pretty color intensive. We have tried to make sure you have enough flexible sources to play your cards on curve.

{%cardlist%}

1 Fabled Passage (ELD) 244

We are running a good number of creature lands to stay aggressive even when we don't draw action.

1 Den of the Bugbear (AFR) 254
1 Crawling Barrens (ZNR) 262
