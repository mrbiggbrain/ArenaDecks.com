## Overview

The release of Jumpstart Historic Horizons (J21)  has brought us a ton of new toys for all the historic formats. But of all the things that J21 has brought us, Slivers has to be the thing I am most excited about. One of my first decks I ever messed around with was a terrible slivers deck. For that reason I am attempting to force it in every format possible, and this weeks Midweek Magic just happens to be Historic Pauper... So here we go with all common slivers! Enjoy. 

## Slivers

The deck runs 24 slivers in the Boros colors. We are mainly focused on giving our slivers first strike and pumping their power. But we can also keep things going with haste and give out slivers vigilance when needed.

## "Slivers"

Who doesn't love an honorary sliver. To help round out our creature selection we have a number of changelings that can benefit from our sliver's ability just like their "Real" brethren.

## Lands

The mana base is pretty simple, some tap lands and basic lands make for a decent mana base for a deck that is not overly greedy.
