Commander

1 Korvold, Fae-Cursed King

{%enddeck%}

## Overview

With the announcement of 100 card Historic Brawl coming back (At least somewhat) permanently I decided there was no better way to celebrate then to brew my very favorite commander for the format {%card%}Korvold, Fae-Cursed King{%endcard%} not once, but **twice**. The first version of the deck I will be showing off is the classic sacrifice deck with some of the newly added cards from Jumpstart Historic Horizons. This version is designed to be filled with brutal advantage, card draw, and overall power.

## Lands

Most of the mana base is pretty basic, a good number of dual lands, some basics, and a few utility lands. But we have made a few specific choices when it comes to the manabase for this deck. We have included all of the fetches, including Evolving Wilds and the honorary member Field of Ruin. We also have a few cards that power up the deck and help it in various situations. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Blast Zone
1 Cryptic Caves
1 Den of the Bugbear
1 Evolving Wilds
1 Fabled Passage
1 Field of Ruin
1 Terramorphic Expanse
1 Field of the Dead
1 Phyrexian Tower
1 Reliquary Tower

{%endcardlist%}

## Ramp

What's a Brawl deck without some ramp? A bad brawl deck that's what. We have a great suite of classic artifact ramp with a small dose of creature ramp included to make sure your always able to play your creatures. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Gilded Goose
1 Arcane Signet
1 Coldsteel Heart

1 Firemind Vessel
1 Black Market

{%endcardlist%}

We also have a treasure token subtheme. These can be used to sacrifice for various abilities, tapped for improvise (thanks to Inspiring Statuary), or sacrificed for mana when you really need to get that last threat online.

## Card Draw

In addition to the powerhouse that is {%card%}Korvold, Fae-Cursed King{%endcard%} we have a decent sized suite of card draw effects. You'll find a heavy emphasis on repeatable card draw that synergizes well with the decks main game plan. Many of these cards are pulling double or triple duty in the deck so not only will you get card advantage, you'll get sacrifice fodder, ramp, and even removal.

## Removal

This deck does not skimp of the removal at all. You'll find answers to most of the common threats such as creatures, artifacts, enchantments, and even lands. The targeted removal package aims to be flexible and give you a good target when you need one.
