## Overview

This deck is about value. We are trying our very best to abuse Grolnok's ability to the fullest using a whole lot of mill effects. This ensures we hit our land drops, our ramp spells, and generally just keep the frogs and "frogs" rolling for even more value. 

## Mill

The deck offers plenty of direct mill effects to abuse Grolnok's effect. Wheter it is attacking with frogs, or simply milling our own library, you'll be gaining plenty of value to keep the plan moving forward. 

{%cardlist%}

{%endcardlist%}

## Frogs

What good is a frog commander if you have no frogs! The deck runs almost every frog I could find. These help trigger Grolnok's ability to keep us churing through the value. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Masked Vandal (KHM) 184
1 Crocanura (J21) 97
1 Galloping Lizrog (RNA) 175
1 Trollbred Guardian (RNA) 148

{%endcardlist%}

We also run a few artifacts that can make frogs. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Birthing Boughs (MH1) 221
1 Maskwood Nexus (KHM) 240

{%endcardlist%}

## Single Target Removal

The single target removal focus on fight spells to try and control the board. We are mostly focused on the early game where our card advantage should carry us. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Blizzard Brawl (KHM) 162
1 Primal Might (M21) 197
1 Decisive Denial (STX) 177
1 Prey Upon (GRN) 143
1 Krosan Grip (STA) 53
1 Masked Vandal (KHM) 184

{%endcardlist%}

## Multi-Target Removal

As we move into the late game we focus heavily on mass bounce spells, Ugin, and Barrier Breach to make sure we can stay alive. Our card advantage should make it pretty easy to find these. 

{%cardlist%}

1 River's Rebuke (XLN) 71
1 Ugin, the Spirit Dragon (M21) 1
1 Consuming Tide (VOW) 53
1 Flood of Tears (M20) 59
1 Barrier Breach (IKO) 145

{%endcardlist%}

## Card Draw

This deck already has huge card advantage because of our commander, but we also want to make sure that we can draw into threats when our commander has been removed, pinned down, or otherwise made unusable. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Wildest Dreams (KLR) 187
1 Teferi's Ageless Insight (M21) 76
1 Gaea's Blessing (DAR) 161
1 Colossal Majesty (M19) 173
1 Beast Whisperer (GRN) 123
1 Guardian Project (RNA) 130
1 Elder Gargaroth (M21) 179
1 Return of the Wildspeaker (ELD) 172
1 The Great Henge (ELD) 161
1 Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath (THB) 229
1 Hydroid Krasis (RNA) 183
1 Excavating Anurid (MH1) 163
1 Realmwalker (KHM) 188
1 Faceless Agent (J21) 1
1 Weight of Memory (DAR) 74

{%endcardlist%}

## Lands

Our manabase is mostly a standard two color simic manabase. 

We are running a number of dual lands. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Barkchannel Pathway (KHM) 251
1 Botanical Sanctum (KLR) 281
1 Breeding Pool (RNA) 246
1 Dreamroot Cascade (VOW) 262
1 Hinterland Harbor (DAR) 240
1 Quandrix Campus (STX) 271
1 Rimewood Falls (KHM) 266
1 Simic Guildgate (RNA) 257
1 Temple of Mystery (M20) 255
1 Thornwood Falls (M20) 258
1 Vineglimmer Snarl (STX) 274
1 Woodland Stream (RIX) 191

{%endcardlist%}

A few any color lands to help us meet color demands. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Command Tower (ELD) 333
1 Mirrodin's Core (JMP) 492

{%endcardlist%}

Some fetch lands to find us the colors we need.

{%cardlist%}

1 Evolving Wilds (RIX) 186
1 Fabled Passage (ELD) 244
1 Terramorphic Expanse (JMP) 78

{%endcardlist%}

The utility lands fill in for some card draw, removal, ramp, and hand limit removal. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Arch of Orazca (RIX) 185
1 Blast Zone (WAR) 244
1 Bonders' Enclave (IKO) 245
1 Field of Ruin (THB) 242
1 Reliquary Tower (M19) 254
1 Castle Vantress (ELD) 242
1 Castle Garenbrig (ELD) 240
1 Sea Gate Restoration (ZNR) 76
1 Khalni Ambush (ZNR) 192

{%endcardlist%}

And finally we fill the rest out with some basic lands. 

{%cardlist%}

6 Snow-Covered Island (MH1) 251
6 Snow-Covered Forest (MH1) 254

{%endcardlist%}

## Ramp

We are running a mostly artifact based removal package. We tend to throw alot of cards into exile, so land based ramp can be hit or miss as we exile away our deck. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Arcane Signet (ELD) 331
1 Coldsteel Heart (CSP) 136
1 Ornithopter of Paradise (MH2) 232
1 Chromatic Lantern (GRN) 233
1 Heraldic Banner (ELD) 222
1 Honored Heirloom (VOW) 257
1 Skyclave Relic (ZNR) 252
1 Firemind Vessel (WAR) 237
1 The Great Henge (ELD) 161

{%endcardlist%}

However we do run a few cards outside this theme. 

- Uro is a powerful card in our colors and since we often play lands from exile, we can often use it;s effect even in the late game. 
- Worldshaper can help us both mill for our commander and get some lands back if we dumped any durring the early game. 
- Wrenn and Seven helps us build big creatures, draw into lands, and put down large numbers of lands when we spend a few turns using our exiled cards. 
- Finally Splendid Reclamation can help us get alot of land into play in the right game. 

{%cardlist%}

1 Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath (THB) 229
1 World Shaper (RIX) 151
1 Wrenn and Seven (MID) 208
1 Splendid Reclamation (VOW) 221
