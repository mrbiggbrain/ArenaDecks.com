This week in **Mid-Priced Mayhem** we check out an awesome Jund Reanimator list. This Artisan deck is packed with ways to get creatures into the graveyard then bring them back for value. You'll find threats like {% card %}Sanctuary Smasher{% endcard %}, {% card %} Krosan Tusker{% endcard %}, and {% card %}Titanoth Rex{% endcard %} which are all excellent threats to reanimate, and great value propositions when cycled. You'll get a card and a small effect out of the deal. 

A small plain removal package of {% card %}Heartless Act{% endcard %} ensures you can deal with creature based threats long enough to reanimate your bigger threats, and {% card %}Back for More{% endcard %} can create some really vicious swings as you block one creature, fight a second creature, and swing in for huge damage the next turn. 

But cycling is not the only way this deck has to get cards into the graveyard, you'll find a small but potent self mill package in {% card %}Mire Triton{% endcard %} and {% card %}Carrion Grub{% endcard %} who doubles as an excellent threat when needed. Finally you'll find a few {% card %}Cathartic Reunion{% endcard %} to help get useless cards out of your hand and find your reanimation spells. 

You'll find no trouble getting creatures back from the graveyard with full playsets of {% card %}Unbreakable Bond{% endcard %} and {% card %}Back for More{% endcard %}, who can smash in quickly due to the two copies of {% card %}Rhythm of the Wild{% endcard %}.

The deck is a super fun, off meta way to enjoy this or future artisan events. I hope you enjoyed this deck, I'll be sure to add plenty more in the future.
