Is this a wizards deck? A dungeon deck? A little of both? You decide in this super janky take on the wizards tribe. I set out to build the best dungeon venturing deck I possibly could, the kind of deck that can consistantly venture through an entire dungeon in a single turn, grinding out value and eventually going infinite to boot. 

Normally the **dungeon** mechanic is about small increnental value. You play something here, get something there, and eventually you might finish the dungeon and get a little reward like some card draw or a small {%card%}omniscience{%endcard%}. But why settle for a partial {%card%}omniscience{%endcard%} when we have the real thing waiting for us right there in Histroic. 

The core of the deck revolves around {%card%}Acererak the Archlich{%endcard%} who has the unique ability to venture and then return itself to hand if you have not completed a specific one of the 3 dungeons. So you keep casting him until you complete the dungeon and you get a 5/5 with huge upside for 3, a decent deal wit a pretty big commitment of resources (Plus the dungeon is brutal and requres you to lose life, creatures, etc). But we don't want to do the fair plan, so we are just never going to complete that dungeon!

We cast {%card%}Acererak the Archlich{%endcard%} and pick any dungeon but "Tomb of Anihilation" and repeat. He comes back to hand and we cast him again... and again... and again. And as we cast him, we copy his triggered ability, again and again... well and again with things like {%card%}Naban, Dean of Iteration{%endcard%} (Hey, Wizards), {%card%}Panharmonicon{%endcard%}, and {%card%}Yarok, the Desecrated{%endcard%} to venture an insane amount of times each turn. 

But why settle for an insane amount of times when we can get an unlimited number of venture triggers. That's where {%card%}Omniscience{%endcard%} comes in. If we can get to 10 mana through treasures and lands, and stick an {%card%}omniscience{%endcard%} we can cast {%card%}Acererak the Archlich{%endcard%} as many times as we want, venturing into the dungeon and gain infinite value. 

The best dungeon I have found is definitly "Lost Mines" since you'll get treasures, drain your opponents, and get to draw cards. Loop though the combo enough and your opponent loses the game. Just in case you're about to draw yourself out you can cast a few {%card%}Gaea's Blessing{%endcard%} to put cards back into your library. 

If your opponent gives you any resistance a full playset of both {%card%}Ravenous Chupacabra{%endcard%} and {%card%}River's Rebuke{%endcard%} help keep things clean.  Finally a playset of {%card%}Cloudkin Seer{%endcard%} helps you draw back into what you need most. 

The deck is fun, but the combo can take a while to execute. You'll need to choose the rooms manually each time which means alot of clicking, and if you need to use blessing (Which you often will) you'll have even more clicking to do there. Plus it relies on a 10 mana enchantment sticking around and a creature that can easily be removed. If your looking for a fun deck to meme about with, this might be your speed, but otherwise it's not aiming to win too often.
