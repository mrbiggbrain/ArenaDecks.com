#### About

Many an adventurer has tried the glorious multi-class in D&D, it sounds like such a good idea, until your character just derps around doing nothing because there's nothing they specialize in enough to be helpful. But today we try and break that curse with **Classy Constellations**, a deck all about using cheap classes to get triggers off of constellation cards. 

The cheap classes? {%card%}Cleric Class{%endcard%}, {%card%}Paladin Class{%endcard%},  {%card%}Druid Class{%endcard%},  and {%card%}Ranger Class{%endcard%} make up the field and costing either a single or at most two mana, they are cheap and efficient ways to trigger our constellation creatures. For constellation we have {%card%}Archon of Sun's Grace{%endcard%} generating board advantage and {%card%}Setessan Champion{%endcard%} helping us draw into more enchantments. 

We are also running a full playset of {%card%}Moon-Blessed Cleric{%endcard%} to help us find our important classes or our full playset of {%card%}Renata, Called to the Hunt{%endcard%}. 

A full playset of {%card%}Doomskar{%endcard%} helps keep aggro decks in check. 

#### Verdict

The deck is fun. It feels like you always have something to do with your mana, from activating levels on your classes to playing all the cards you draw. {%card%}Setessan Champion{%endcard%} can get big, draw you into lands which help trigger {%card%}Druid Class{%endcard%} which helps trigger {%card%}Cleric Class{%endcard%}, which just kind of keeps you alive and chugging along.

However; The deck is not competitive. It lacks any real answers for control beyond it's low CMC, and with only 4 board wipes it can be difficult to keep up with decks who are dropping a must answer every turn. 

It's a fun deck for a short spin, but not one you'll want to grind the ladder with even on a calm day.
