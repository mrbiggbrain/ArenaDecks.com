## Overview

This deck started as a simple premise, what would it look like if you built a sliver deck with Collected Company. Boros slivers is by far the best supported of the colors in terms of small aggressive threats so we took that shell and added green for CoCo to end up with a pretty fun deck. 

## CoCo

Collected company is probably one of the better cards in the format. Great at recovering from wraths and dealing with Planeswalkers, this card can help us setup explosive turns and kill out of nowhere.

## Slivers

The slivers in the deck are pretty close to the ones you would find in a standard Boros list. But we have dropped a few of the lower power ones to play some green cards.

## "Slivers"

We are running a small selection of changelings to help with card advantage and raw power. Dipping into green allows us to play Realmwalker which can help us have some explosive turns, while Faceless Agent helps us find more action.

## Support

We are also running vanquishers banner as a way to keep our hand full and give our slivers just a little oomph.

## Lands

Shocks and Tribal lands plus a forest and mountain help us cast our cards on curve. The only card we can;t cast directly off our tribal lands is CoCo and we are running 9 green lands plus manaweft meaning we can almost always count on casting it on curve.
