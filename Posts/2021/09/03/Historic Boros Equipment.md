## Overview

Boros has to be my favorite color combination. The combination of aggressive creatures with support and synergy pieces just makes my heart flutter. This Boros equipment list is no different, packing aggressive early game pieces as well as cards to keep you competitive into the mid and sometimes even late game. 

## Name of the Game

The name of the game is equipment. We are running a total of 17 equipment in the deck, ensuring we almost always have something to put onto our little dudes. We have something for almost every situation including ways to grant lifelink, first strike, flying, trample, vigilance, and even ward. Plus Nettlecycst can ensure our creatures get big threatening our opponents at every turn.

## Little Big Dudes

What good are equipment with no one to wield them. We are packing some great targets for our equipment. Each one of these creatures gets massive when wielding equipment and ensures that we always have the biggest thing on the battlefield.

## Support

We are also packing a decent support package with ways to make sure we can both draw into and play our equipment turn after turn. Akiri and Sram keep the cards flowing, Fighter Class helps us search up the answers we need (And helps us get everything equipped late game) and Danitha supports us as both a great target for equipment and a ramp spell.

## Lands

No deck is complete without a compliment of lands. Most of the mana base is focused around untapped lands. We are using pathways, shocks, and even a few fast lands to ensure we get our early game plays out where they can make the most impact. We are also running a few copies of Castle Ardenvale to give us late game protection against removal heavy decks and a Bonders' Enclave as a late game mana sink. The rest is basic lands.
