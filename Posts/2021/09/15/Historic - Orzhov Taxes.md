## Overview

Who doesn't love paying their taxes? This deck is all about using taxing effects in the form of enchantments and artifacts to slowly stop our opponents from being able to execute their game plan. And if our opponent should get a foothold you can easily wipe them away with a huge count of main deck board wipes. 

## Curse You!

We run alot of taxing effects. You'll find something here for a majority of matchups. We can tax creatures, card draw, and even doing flat out nothing.

## Value

Why tax others if you can't get rich yourself. We get payed just for doing what we already want to be doing, and we get payed well.

## Enough Already

Sometimes you just need the board cleaned up a little. We have a whopping 8 board wipes to make sure aggro can;t chip in too much before we get our lifegain and other payoffs on the board.

## Lands

Our manabase leans heavily on dual lands to make sure we can cast all our spells on curve. A few castles and some utility lands help us grind through when things turn sideways.

## Side Hussle

The sideboard is mostly outfitted to bring in answers to aggro or control. But we do also have decent answers to graveyard decks and some protection vs   combo or go wide decks like goblins.
