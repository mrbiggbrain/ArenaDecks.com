## Overview

Set mechanics tend to be a lot of fun to build around. Sometimes they can be a little parasitic, but more and more often now they can open themselves up to the wider card pool in a format and really shine. This deck is definitely on the more parasitic front. 

Blitz is the new set mechanic for SNC and it's a pretty cool mechanic. It plays similar to dash where you pay a different cost to cast the creature and give it haste, but with Blitz instead of returning it to hand, you sacrifice it and draw a card. This lets us get up to some shenanigans with Riveteers Ascendancy to help us return creature to the battlefield in addition to drawing our card. 

## Blitz

The main core of the deck is the assortment of blitz cards. Most of these are pretty low power, but we have the opportunity to cast them for their blitz cost and then return them to the battlefield later. It also means we have a large number of hasty creatures for finishing off Planeswalkers or getting in those last few points of damage after a wrath.

## Riveteers Ascendancy

This is one of our main synergy pieces and ensures we never run out of gas once we get going.

## The Rest

The rest of the non-lands are a few pieces to help hold the deck together. Blood on the snow gives us a little mass removal. Abrade and Riveteers Charm lets us deal with troublesome permanents, and Village Rites let's us really abuse the fact our creatures are going to die anyways to keep us churning through cards.
