## Overview

Greasefang is a pretty busted card. I don't know what more can really be said about that. This deck revolves around using it's reanimation ability to bring back a Parhelion II that can smack my opponents in the face. 

Unlike other versions of this combo this deck aims to add resiliency by having some interaction and additional discard outlets. 

## The Combo

The combo consits of a discarded Parhelion II, and a Greasefang, Okiba Boss. We use Greasefangs ability to reanimate Parhelion and then smack face.

## Team Players

Unlike other decks we are not aimed at hitting the combo as quickly as possible. We have a good selection of team players who help us setup some pretty disgusting board states that can make it hard for our opponents to claw their way back. Discard outlets, blink effects, and board wipes help us run a midrange game plan until we can smack in. 

All-stars Can't Stay Away and Elspeth Conquers Death help us get our Greasfang back on the board. While Justiciar's Portal let's us  evade targeted removal to continue our combo.
