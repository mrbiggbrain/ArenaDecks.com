## Overview

Thousand-Year storm is an expensive multi-color enchantment that does not win the game it comes down and requires you to cast multiple spells to get any value... so obviously we are building around it. 

This deck has been around for a really long time, but a recent push for treasures in both MH2 and recent standard releases has finally given it the little extra that it needs. 

## Thousand-Year Storm

If this card can stick things can get crazy fast. Our deck draws cards and makes treasures, and it does a ton of both. Every time we cast an instant or sorcery we copy it for each instant and sorcery we have already cast this turn. This means a few opts into a Strike it rich into an Unexpected Windfall is quite the windfall indeed.

## Treasures

The thing that makes this deck click is it's treasure production. In the past the deck relied on casting a few small spells then using a ton of mana to cast a Brass's Bounty which let the deck go off. However recently we have had a ton of really great treasure producers made, often with value bolted on in the form of card draw. 

Cards like Pirate's Pillage and Unexpected Windfall can quickly get out of hand, while Strike It Rich is free storm count, and can be recast from the graveyard to really go crazy once we get going. 

Finally Xorn and Storm-Kiln Artist start getting really out of hand if not answered, and Brass's Bounty can often produce hundreds of mana to carry us to the win.

## Card Draw

Once we have all that mana we need something to use it on. What's better then drawing cards.

## Finish It

So we have hundreds of mana, and have drawn most of our deck. What do we do now, I guess we win the game. Our finisher of choice is usually Banefire since it can't be countered, however with a high enough storm count Play with Fire gets the job done.
