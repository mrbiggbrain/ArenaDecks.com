## Overview

Muldrotha Pod has been one of my favorite decks for a really long time. I played this deck in standard, then historic, and now I am taking it for a spin in Explorer. Much of what made this deck good in [The Historic Version]({{/Posts/2022/02/26/Muldrotha%20Pod/  | URL }}) carries over with some new tech we didn't have previously. 

## The Core

The core of this deck is based around "Pod" effects. A pod effect is one that can sacrifice a creature to grab a creature one mana value higher from the deck. This allows us to grab creatures with useful effects and tackle whatever our opponent is doing. In addition to these pod effects we are also running some graveyard recursion in the form of Muldrotha. Muldrotha allows us to play permanents such as creatures, enchantments, and lands from the graveyard which can help us bring back creatures we previously sacrificed.

## Toolbox

In pod decks it's common to call the list of creatures you usually intend to tutor your "Toolbox." It's a collection of tools you can use to handle whatever the opponent throws at you. We include creature removal, artifact and enchantment removal, ramp and even graveyard recursion.

## Recursion

A major theme of the deck is recurring these creature to destroy any plan our opponent may have and overcome their interaction. We run a nice selection of cards that can help us recur threats.
