## Overview

Sometimes an idea just bounced around in your head all day, and this was one of those ideas. A value oriented deck that aims to blink ETB creatures and slowly attack in for chip damage, this deck is all about small incremental advantage. 

## Blink

We are running three main blink effects: Teleportation Circle, Soulherder, and Charming Prince. Their job is simple, let us reoccur our ETB effects for value.

We are also running Panharmonicon to double up our blink effects.

## Bestest Blinkers

What good are blink effects without ETBs. We run card draw, bounce, and even destroy effects to help keep our opponents decks in check.
