## Overview

This deck is all about drawing cards and gaining value. The combination of Stormchaser Drake and Ivy, Gleeful Spellthief means that we are often drawing extra cards and doubling up our auras each turn for explosive turns. Our protection spells work overtime, and our combat tricks are synergistic with the rest of the deck. Let's prove you don;t need white to play auras. 

## Value Town

Our deck is built around getting extra value off of our aura's that means using Stormchaser Drake to draw extra cards and Ivy to double up those aura's to really send home the value. But all that extra card draw can be pushed just a little further using Ledger Shredder to help filter away extra lands and find us action. 

You'll even find that all our threats are creatures with flying meaning opponents will have a hard time chipping in via the air, or blocking our giant creatures when we alpha strike.

## Protecting Our Threats

A common problem for aura decks is that once you load up your threats they tend to draw removal pretty quickly. To help with that we are running two full playsets of cards that can help us beat interaction. Cradle of Safety can give our creatures hexproof, plus a permanent +1/+1, while Tamiyo's Safekeeping helps protect against single target interaction and board wraths as well. Best of all both get doubled by Ivy's ability to really put our opponent in a bind.

## Aura's

Finally the deck is built around a bunch of Auras. You'll find card draw, unblockable, and combat tricks among our arsenal here. Don't let the size fool you, we draw tons of cards and will find what we are looking for.

## Finally

We have a little removal in Tail Swipe. This just helps us clear up the board and keep the game moving in our direction.
