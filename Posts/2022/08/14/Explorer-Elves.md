## Overview

Elves is a classic tribe that is all about going wide. Historically the deck has used Craterhoof Behemoth to end games, but that card is not available in Explorer. But don;t worry, we have a plan for building our own Cratehoof, tutoring for End-Raze Forerunners using Finale of Devastation for X=10+.

## Ramp, Ramp, and More Ramp

Casting a Finale for X=10 or more is not an easy task, at least under normal circumstances. Your going to need at least 12 mana, and it's only good if you have also built up a pretty wide board as well. But elves are pretty good at two things, making mana and going wide. A good part of our deck makes mana and once we get enough elves on the battlefield a single Circle of Dream Druid can let us cast massive Finale's that just end the game on the spot.

## Going Wide

For Circle of Dream Druid to really take over the game we need a massive amount of creatures. Luck for us the other thing elves do is go wide. Decks like this are often called "Elfball" because once they get rolling they are difficult to stop. Collected Company helps us get important pieces of the battlefield while cards like Beast Whisperer, Elivish Visonary, and Llanowar Visionary draw us into more action so we can use all the mana we generate. Last but not Least, Elvish Warmaster can give us blockers for the early game and pump up our Creature counts for some pretty massive game ending plays.
