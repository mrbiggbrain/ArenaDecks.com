## Overview

With the recent release of the Baldur's Gate Alchemy set dragons have taken center stage. This deck is attempting to abuse large dragons along with the ability of Ambitious Dragonborn and new green mill spells to cheat out massive creatures for little cost. 

## Dragons

What would a dragon deck be without dragons. We are running a number of beefy dragons to make sure e always have the biggest thing on the board.

## Mill

We are trying to use our big dragons to power out big Ambitious Dragonborns to gain early advantage. As part of that plan we are running a bunch of mill cards that put cards into our graveyard then allow us to return them to hand if we choose.

## Support

We are also running a few support cards to help us combat our opponents plans. Tamiyo's Safekeeping lets us protect our big threats. Fight Rigging gives us a little advantage and let's us scale thing as the game progresses plus helps us get our big things into play easier. Finally Blizzard Brawl acts as a little removal to keep the board clear.
