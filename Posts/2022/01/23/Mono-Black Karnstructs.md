## Overview

This deck is focused around producing very large Karnstruct tokens, then giving them lifelink. We are pretty low to the ground and focused on putting as many artifacts as possible onto the battlefield. Then we use cards like Karn, Scion of Urza or Nettlecyst to make large tokens that scale with our artifacts. Finally we attempt to bridge to the late game suing lifelink granting effects to overcome aggro. 

## Cheap Artifacts

The deck revolves around having a decent stream of cheap artifacts. A turn 1 blood fountain can set us up for a massive karnstructs as early as T4. Gingerbrute and Vault Skirge act as backups when our Karnstructs and Germs bite the dust and can quickly close out games when they come back after a well times Blood on the Snow.

## Big Karnstructs

Once we have filled the board with artifacts it's time to put down our win conditions. These things can get massive with enough time and effort so the opponent is going to need to deal with them immediately to prevent us running away with the game. We are almost always ticking down Karn when we can, but his plus ability is nice for a little card advantage if he sticks around. 

These big beaters will be a lightning rod for removal, so make sure to play them out when it makes sense to limit the impact on your plans.

## The Rest

The rest of the deck is card draw, and removal, this helps us keep the board clear and the threats rolling.

## Wish Board

We are using a pretty focused list of lessons to fetch up with Poet's Quill. Everything from some removal to some land fetching effects for when we get stuck at 2 mana and some recursion for Karn.
