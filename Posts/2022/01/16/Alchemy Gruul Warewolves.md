## Overview

I feel like the werewolf tribe has not got enough love in Alchemy. It's a fun and fast deck that can close out games rather quickly and grows faster then most of the other decks in the format. Once you get Halana out the deck tends to just roll over anything but the very top of the Meta, and Kessig Naturalist makes that possible as early as turn three. 

## Werewolves

The deck is an agressive creature based deck. We usually start out strong with early plays like Kessig Naturalist, Rahilda, Wanted Cutthroat  or Werewolf Pack Leader. We then have options such as Tovolar, or Reckless Stormseeker to keep things moving. THe deck has plenty of haymakers for the late game as well.

## Support

In addition to our werewolves we also have a few key support pieces. Halana and Alena enable us to give our werewolves a power boost and haste them the turn they come out, while Arlinn lets us create a few blockers and flash in unexpected threats to mess with our opponents plans.

## Removal

Our werewolves are usually bigger then our opponents on curve, so we are using cheap fight spells to control the board.

## Lands

Out manabase is standard Gruul faire. Some pathways and slow lands along with snow lands and a few ambushes mean we are usually playing on curve.
