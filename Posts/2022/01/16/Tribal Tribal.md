## Overview

Someone once told me that if your having trouble coming up with a fun deck idea, just choose a tribe. But sometimes you also have issues picking a tribe. FOr those occassions I present to you Tribal Tribal, a deck that jams a whole bunch of tribes into a tiny little package. 

It's lords and slivers and enablers all packed together into a package filled with changelings to use them all. 

## Tribes

Lords, lords and more lords. The deck contains a bunch of singelton lords to give our changelings a range of enhancements. These lords can give everything from first strike to power boosts to island walk and ward.

## Changelings

What good are our lords of only a few creatures can use them. We run a wide selection of changgelings and changeling generators to make sure every lord we play has something to power up.

## Draw

Running so many changelings it's likely we are going to have a decent number of them on the battlefield at the same time. We run four copies of Distant Melody to make sure we can draw a large number of cards to refill our hands.
