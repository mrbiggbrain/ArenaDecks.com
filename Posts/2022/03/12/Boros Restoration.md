## Overview

This combo deck is all about discarding enchantments to return them using Brilliant Restoration. You'll be using damage dealing enchantments to destroy your opponents life in a single turn. 

## Discard

We are using red rummage effects to dig through our deck and put our enchantments in to the graveyard. Faithless looting is very efficient in the deck, making sure we can start digging as early as turn one and the flashback gives us both card advantage and efficiency for our investment. Cathartic Pyre offers a flexible spell that can deal with creatures or Planeswalkers as well as being a rummage effect when we need. Finally Unexpected Windfall helps ramp us into our Brilliant Restoration while digging through our deck and getting our payoffs into the graveyard.

## Payoffs

The main payoff of our deck is returning damage dealing cards from the graveyard to the battlefield in one big turn. Cards like Omen of the Forge and Trial of Zeal can deal damage directly to our opponents face, while Combustible Gearhulk helps us mill cards into our graveyard, gives us card advantage, and hits our opponents in the face. 

But it's Fiery Emancipation really pulling it's weight. Having one of these in the graveyard with a resolved Brilliant Restoration means a ton of damage going to our opponents face, and two is lethal and a half in most cases.

## Brilliant Restoration

Our namesake card does one thing and one thing only, brings back all the enchantments we have milled. We are going for a one turn kill, so most of the game will be spent digging for this card and discarding anything we want in the GY for value.

## Synergy Pieces

We are also running a few synergy pieces to help us get to our combo. Irencrag Pyromancer comes down early and turns our draw spells into bolts to deal with early game aggro creatures. Mizzix's Mastery can turn into a massive amount of card advantage, a cheap Brilliant Restoration, or even both in the same turn if we are willing to invest some major mana.
