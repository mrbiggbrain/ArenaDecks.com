## Overview

The Alchemy format is pretty wide open right now. Aggressive, controlling and even midrange strategies can find their place in the format and with a dynamic and wide meta they can often even find success. 

This Rakdos Midrange deck is designed to out value opponents and close out games unexpectedly. A large amount of artifact synergies, treasures, and agressive creatures means the deck can often find purchase against aggro and try to go under control. 

## Treasures

One of the main synergies of the deck is treasures. Many of our cards care about them in some fashion. Magda can generate treasures and use them to grab a Goldspan Dragon or another artifact. Goldspan Dragon can run away with games and Unexpected Windfall helps us get rid of cards we do not want or turn lands into action once we curve out.

## Artifact Synergies

But how are we using all these artifacts?

Dragonspark Reactor can gain some serious counters. Every time we put a treasure or another artifact onto the battlefield its going to get a counter. That means it will grow large quickly and let us hit our opponent in the face in addition to dealing with a blocker or other threat. This is especially true with the work Oni-Cult anvil is putting in draining our opponent and powering up our reactors. 

Rounding out the deck are cards like Voltage surge (For dealing with creatures and Planeswalkers), Deadly Dispute for drawing cards, and Soulripper for a wrath resistant threat that can grow out of control.
