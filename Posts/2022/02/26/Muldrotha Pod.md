## Overview

Muldrotha Pod has been one of my go to decks since it was standard legal. The deck is a blast to play and tends to be very grindy as you make both small and big swings. You'll have the opportunity to blowout your opponent with massive turns where you level their game plan, but also to slowly destroy your opponents resources. 

The main game plan is using Prime Speaker Vannifar and Muldrotha, the Gravetide to use toolbox creatures to answer or disrupt your opponents plan. The deck centers around ETB based removal to reoccour with Muldrotha or tutor up with Vannifar. 

## Main Players

Prime Speaker Vannifar is a "fixed" version of Birthing Pod, it allows you to tutor up a creature with Mava Value one greater then the sacrificed creature. We can use this to quickly progress from 2 or 3 mana creatures all the way up to massive 6 drops including our namesake Muldrotha, the Gravetide. Both these cards allow us to create a toolbox of creatures to answer our opponents threats.

## Prime Targets

In addition to Muldrotha we have several targets up the MV ladder to pick from. Removal, Forced Sacrifice, Graveyard Effects, Lifegain, etc. Ravenous Chupacabra and Cavalier of Night can do some work keeping the board clear along with Massacre Wurm when it's filled with small tokens.

## Untap

Being able to untap with a Vannifar is big, but being able to do it twice in one turn can outvalue the opponent quickly. We run a few cards that can help us abuse our podding ability for huge gain.
