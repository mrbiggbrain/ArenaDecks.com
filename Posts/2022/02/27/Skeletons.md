## Overview

The skeleton tribe is an often overlooked tribe. However; With it's ability for explosive turns and inevitability it can be an excellent choice for an aggro deck. I have previously posted a budget version of this deck, but this one has a little more teeth. 

## Skeletons

What good is a tribal deck without some tribe members. Our ranks might seem low, but the skeleton tribe is great at inevitability. We can return skeletons from the graveyard and generate skeleton tokens to power up our ranks.

Speaking of tokens we are running one of the best token generators in the game, Skeletal Swarming does a great job of turning our ranks into an even bigger threat and doing so quickly. Death-Priest of Myrkul helps us recover lost creatures and Parallel Lives makes sure we are almost always on the profitable side of trades.

## Card Draw

One of the issues decks like this tend to have is that they run out of gas pretty quickly. This deck tries to use the facts that most of our skeletons are easy to kill, and that we actively want them to die, to our advantage. We are running Moldervine Reclamation to help with agressive decks and Village Rites to help trigger our death triggers.

## Removal

We are an aggro deck at our core. That means we don't want to wipe the board over and over. For that reason we are running some flexible targeted removal in Binding the Old Gods and a partial board wipe in Extinction Event.
