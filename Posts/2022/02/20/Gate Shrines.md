## Overview

This deck is an attempt to merge two of my favorite archetypes into a single functional deck. Shrine decks need pretty fixed mana, which normally means lots of rares spent on dual lands to make sure your hitting your plays on curve. This is counter to the entire concept of a budget deck, often leaving players having to play bad tap lands. This is my first attempt to attempt to workaround that shotfall by using another parasitic mechanic from Ravnica.

 Gates is an archetype that cares about you playing Gates, and all the gates come into play tapped. Playing gates gives us access to several payoff cards, from fetching dual color lands, to wiping the board, to a big beater that can end the game. These cards help us have a payoff for all our lands coming in tapped. 

Overall like most shrine decks this deck aims to gain advantage while trying to slowly reduce your opponents resources. You have several methods to end the game, from hitting your opponent in the face with small creatures, to draining their life away. You'll also have plenty of chances to remove your opponents creatures and keep your life total high along the way. The deck can require careful piloting and thought since you'll often need to plan a few turns ahead to know which is the right play to make to stay alive. 

## Shrines

First and formost this deck is a shrines deck. We are playing at least one copy of every uncommon shrine. With most of them having two copies in the deck. This includes all three cycles of shrines across Magics history. The only shrine we are not playing is the rare five color one since it does not fit our budget requirements.

Speaking of payoff cards we run a few powerful payoffs for the deck. Gates Ablaze ensures we can keep the board clear when we want, while Gatebreaker Ram helps us put in the last few points of damage. Finally  Circuitous Route helps us ramp and fix our colors to make sure we can keep putting pressure on the board.

## A Final Note

This deck is suppose to be a fun and mostly free way to play a few games in historic. It's not designed to win you every game, or compete in tournaments. It takes zero rares and does fine in the Play queue, but if your looking to break the Historic meta, look elsewhere.
