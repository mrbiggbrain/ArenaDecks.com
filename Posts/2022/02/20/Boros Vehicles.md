## Overview

I simply love Vehicle decks. They are some of my favorite decks to build and play. So when I saw that Vehicles were a major theme in Kamigawa Neon Dynasty I just had to upgrade my deck to take advantage of some of these sweet new cards. 

## Vehicles

What good is a vehicles deck without a ton of vehicles. This deck is packed full of some of the best ones ever released. 

Parhelion II is a behemoth that quickly ends games. It's ability to pump out tokens that can later crew it means that things tend to quickly spiral out of control. Reckoner Bankbuster is an awesome card draw engine that can help us draw into action when we need it and even produces a pilot when we flood out a little too much on our vehicles. The ETB effects on Surgehacker Mech and Skysoverign, Console Flagship help us deal with calue creatures and chump blockers while Weatherlight helps us find action and Peacewalker Colossus helps us deal with board wraths and go wide.

## Pilots

Although we have ways to crew our vehicles without needing creatures on the board, we still want to have enough ways to trigger them when needed. Magda, Brazen Outlaw is an insane card in our deck often gaining us some early game mana advantage or fetching a Parhelion II or another vehicle from our deck. Sram, Senior Edificer and Depala, Pilot Exemplar gives us some card advantage and Hotshot Mechanic lets us crew all our vehicles for only a single mana, on a body that is far from useless as an attacker.

## Synergy Pieces

Vehicles are such a major part of our strategy that we need to have ways to crew them even when the opponent is dealing with our creatures. For that reason we run a few ways to help us crew our vehicles from an empty board. 

Siege Modification can help us get in with early Magda attacks, or turn one of our bigger vehicles into a very hard to deal with threat. We also have access to Mech Hanger to crew our threats and Sokenzah to add a few instant speed creatures to the board. Finally Peacewalker lets us go wide with vehciles even if the opponent is wrating the board every turn.
