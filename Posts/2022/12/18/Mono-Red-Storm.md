## Overview

There's nothing like pulling off an infinite combo to really make your day. There is just something about watching your opponent slowly lose the game as you pull off each step again and again. This deck is built around the fact that you can copy Spellchain Scatter with another Spellchain Scatter. Add in something that makes mana when you cast a spell and you get infinite cast triggers. Once we have infinte cst triggers we can ping our opponents to death, or cast a massive Grapeshot to finish things off. 

## Infinite Spells

The first part of the combo requires getting infinite spells. That means getting two Spellchain Scatters, we can either draw two naturally or use Dreadhorde Arcanist or Underworld Breach to recast one from our graveyard.

We also need a way to keep casting them as we conjure them. That is where Birgi and Storm-Kiln Artist come in. Both of us reward us with a single mana for casting a spell so we go even on Spellchain Scatter.

## Infinite Damage

Casting an unlimited number of spells is pretty cool, but not really going to win us the game. TO do that we need to hit our opponent in the face for lethal. The deck aims to do that in one of two ways. The first is ping effects like Kessig Flamebreather and Electrostatic Field that let us deal damage every time we cast a spell.

And the second is casting a massive Grapeshot, which takes a little more mana so we either need 1 extra mana or two mana generators on board.
