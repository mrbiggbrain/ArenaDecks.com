## Overview

This Mill deck is trying to do something a little different then most of the current Mill decks in the format. Where many of them are trying to slowly mill opponents out, we are trying to abuse Keening Stone to take the opponent out in a few very big swings. 

## Getting Started

Keening Stone really only works when the opponents has a few cards in their graveyard so we are using low cost mill options like Mesmeric Orb, Teferi's Tutelage, and Ruin Crab to get things started.

## Finishing The Job

Once we have started things off we can make some pretty big swings with Keening Stone, especially when backed up by Bruvac. This combo can very quickly take our small early gains and multiply them several times over.

But getting to a 6 Mana artifact and paying 7 to activate is no easy task so we are running a little ramp too. This just helps us get to our big payoff a little faster.
