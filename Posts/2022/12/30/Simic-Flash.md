## Overview

**Better get ready to run, We're flashing people in Explorer.**

What I love about Simic Flash is it's a little of everything. It's got heavy controlling elements, but also plays aggressive value creatures. It can control the board with counters, or tempo players out. It tries to play it's game plan on the opponents turn. It rewards tight plays but is not too difficult to pick up well enough to win. Overall I also think it's a deck not getting enough attention. It use to dominate low and even some higher level tournaments and I think people just think it's been power creeped out by newer sets. 

## Counters

We really don't want our opponent doing anything, especially anything big. That would ruin all the fun. One of the main plans of the deck is to hold up counter spells to counter anything our opponents might try and do, then deploy flash threats when they end their turn. Frilled Mystic is an especially potent card since it allows us to put some aggression onto the board while hard countering something our opponent is doing. Decisive Denial acts as a soft counter and allows us to use the fight side to remove value and early game creatures that might slip through our counters.

## Flashy

Once we have countered our opponents threats we can start deploying our own. Voracious Greatshark and Brazen Borrower help us clear up any creatures that might have slipped in. Nightpack Ambusher puts a real threat onto the board we can often protect with cheap counters like Spell Pierce and makes a blocker or adds to our clock every turn. Sea-Dasher Octopus can help us with a little card advantage while Brineborn Cutthroat scales pretty well through the game making our clock very solid.
