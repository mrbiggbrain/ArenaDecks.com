## Overview

Lord of the Rings is here and with it comes a whole lot of legendary creatures. Today I have chosen one of those creature to build a Historic Brawl deck with and it's a bit of an against the odds type affair. We are aiming to win the game with Frodo's alternate win condition. To do so we need to have the ring tempt us four times, and level up Frodo twice, and then successfully hit our opponent with said Frodo. 

This is one of the easier alternate win conditions that have come out, but it's also pretty easy for our opponents to defend against. That means we will have to get smart and sneak in our hits to really make our chances count. 

## Tempting

For Frodo to hand us the win we have to be tempted four times before we deal combat damage with him. Our commander does have a built in way to let us be tempted, but to do that we need to level him up twice and deal damage which tends to be rather slow. To help speed up the clock we have some powerful cards that can help us get tempted a little faster. 

Call of the Ring is a powerhouse in this deck, coming down early and giving us both card advantage and tempting us every turn. The deck contains a whopping 9 Nazgûls which gives us an awesome source of both tempting and a payoff for our other tempt sources. Finally Witch-king of Angmar helps us  both fend off attacks and get a few extra tempts out of the deal.

## Unblockable

To successfully win the game we need to actually hit our opponents, and those opponents will normally have something to block with. That is why the deck packs so many sources of making our Frodo unblockable. Cards like Access Tunnel, Bilibo's Ring, and Thieves' Tools help us chip in for damage while Zephyr Boots let's us crash in over the ground creatures. Plus our ring bearer will have an easy time crashing in through big creatures.

## The Rest

The rest of the deck is built with lots of ramp, card draw, and ways to keep Frodo on the battlefield. We areally want to keep the deck churning because we tend to get hit with lots of hate as people realize we are investing lots of mana into something that will kill them in one hit and can't be blocked.
