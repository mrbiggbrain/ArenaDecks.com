## Overview

This deck is crazy fast. Your going to be aiming to destroy your opponents life total in as few turns as possible, it's the definition of agressive, and the very soul of burn them out. The deck revolves around playing one of it's two main creatures, or it's one mana threat and then playing burn spell after burn spell until your opponents die. 

## Threats

Our threat package scales with the number of instants and sorceries we cast each turn. And our goal is to play a whole lot of spells in a single turn. Kiln Fiend and Festival Crasher can get very big, very fast threatening a whole lot of damage that can close out the game. Monastery Swiftspear backs them up with an early game drop we can pump up to dent our opponents life.

## Burn

None of our creatures have trample so it's important to both get early game creatures out of play and cast spells to pump up our creatures. All our burn spells can go face except for Searing Blood which bolts our opponent in the face when they block.

## Support

We are running a pretty small support package that lets us keep the damage rolling and in the case of Temur Battle Rage closes things out VERY quickly when we cast it. Mechanized Warfare is a great option durring setup turns and Castle Embereth can help us with just a few more points of damage when we swing out with a few creatures.
