## Overview

Greasefang, Phoenix, Sacrifice, Reanimator. If your planning on playing in Explorer you better bring some graveyard hate. But what if you **almost exclusively** bring graveyard hate? Today's lesson is in picking your matchups and committing. We are going to run a giant pile of graveyard hate and see if we can take a few wins along the way. 

## Graveyard Hate

These are the actual direct graveyard hate cards. They take cards in graveyards and exile them. Kaya is pulling double duty as a finisher as well. If you can tick her up to ultimate you can do some serious damage to your opponents. But the rest of the cards are definitely in the top tier of power and pull their weight.

## Exiled

The majority of the remaining cards are trying to exile cards from the board. Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet does a great job of keeping up with aggro and makes many sacrifice players just give up. The Wandering Emperor is a powerful card that can deal with any big things coming in and helps us keep our other threats buffed up and controlling the board.
