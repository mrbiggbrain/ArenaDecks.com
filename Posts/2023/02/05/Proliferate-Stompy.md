## Overview

**Phyrexia: All Will Be One** is right around the corner and that means that poison is coming back, and boy is it coming back. But I thought it might be fun to try and make poison work in Explorer before ONE launches in a couple days. This deck is a Selesnya stompy deck built around putting counters on things and then proliferating to make them huge. But we also have just a little bit of poison in Fynn and Ajani. Our hope is that we can get a couple poison counters on an opponent and then just proliferate away, but we can definitely take games with our beefy creatures as well. 

## Poison

We are running a very small number of spells that can get poison counters onto our opponent. This is mostly a backup plan for slow grindy matchups where we can probably proliferate our opponent to death. But I have definitely gotten wins of Fynn and even a couple Ajani ultimates.

## +1/+1 Counters

A more practical win condition for the deck is killing our opponents with damage. We want to beef up a couple creatures with counters and then swing in for damage.

## Extra Counters

Once we get a few counters onto players or permanents we really want to proliferate them. Grateful Apparition comes down early and can be a real threat with great synergies in the mid to late game, while Karn's Bastion is an ever present threat of activation. Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider might not directly proliferate but it makes everything our deck wants to do that much better. It can mean massive blowouts as we proliferate.

## Final Words

I think this deck is going to get a huge makeover when ONE launches. With new proliferate options, the addition of toxic, and the sheer power of some of the new cards it's going to be a much more tuned and efficient deck that is winning from multiple angles. 

I am very excited to see which can see play and which will end up not mattering at all.
