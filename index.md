### Welcome!

I would like to personally welcome you to ArenaDecks.com. I started this site to share my love of Magic the Gathering with the world. This site hosts the many deck I build and play. Some of them are janky and fun, while others designed to grind out the ladder. Regardless of their intentions each one is a work of passion that I have sunk my heart into and I hope you find your diamond among the rough within. 

If your looking for my newest decks, check out the list to the right. If your trying to find something I did in the past, checkout the [Archive](/archive/), or use the search in the top right of the screen. 

Finally, if your looking for the ever popular Historic Starter Decks you can find them [here](/Starter-Decks-Historic/).
