## About

ArenaDecks.com is about everything I love about Magic the Gathering: Arena, and MtG in general. It contains the fruits of my passions, from decks, to guides, to my opinions of the news of the day. It's deigned to be clean and simple, with an interface that makes it easy to view the decks I have so much passion for. I work hard to add features and make sure that you can enjoy my decks as much as I do.

## About Development

I started sharing my decks for Magic the Gathering: Arena a few years ago. I wanted to interact more with the community and showing off the cool stuff I was working on seemed like a great way to do so. It started by buying the ArenaDecks.com domain and putting up a rather simple WordPress site and using a deck layout generator I found on the web for WordPress. I hosted that site for a couple years, hosting on AWS LightSail and going about my life. 

But the more and more I tried to post, the more painful it become. I wanted to write content and work on decks, but I had to spend much of my time working on formatting and fixing little layout bugs. To top all of that off, I had to keep the site updated, work on the layout, and deal with spam, backups, and things I just never wanted to deal with (I do IT for a living, I don;t want to do it as a hobby.)

So at the beginning of 2021 I made a promise to myself, I would find a better way. A way that had me focusing on making content I loved, and sharing the game I loved playing. I had a big list of things I wanted, and no idea how to get there. 

It took me a while but I finally found something that excited me. [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) is a static site generator that takes plain text markdown files, templates, JavaScript, and other static resources and build beautiful static sites that can be deployed. The more I used this workflow, the more I loved it. I got to write in simple markdown, write clean and simple JavaScript, author easy to follow templates, and got out gorgeous looking blog posts for free.
